                  <h2>What is IMEI number?</h2>
                  
                  <p>
                    International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI), is used to identify a particular mobile phone. Every mobile phone comes with an IMEI and they're unique globally. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And because these IMEI are unique across all devices with them, Menpha employs that uniqueness in its reporting system, preventing a single IMEI from being added twice.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    With this in mind, you can expect only a single result whenever you search against my database. If you do not come across a results of your search query, then it is likely the device is still in safe hands and you can proceed to purchase.

                  <p>Menpha is an easy-to-use web app developed to solve a single task, and solve it well!</p>

                    <ul>
                      <li>Add your IMEI numbers of any device type you own (for instance, your smartphone) and indicate whether its with you or not.</li>
                      <li>Search for any IMEI number and know whether its stolen or missing.</li>
                      <li>Share with your friends when you learn an IMEI is no longer with the owner (in other words, its stolen or missing)</li>
                    </ul>
                  </p>
                  <p>
