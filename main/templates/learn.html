                  <h2>How to use Menpha</h2>
                  <p>Menpha is an easy-to-use web app developed to solve a single task, and solve it well!</p> <br/>
                  <p>
                  Menpha involves three easy, fast steps. You're good to carry on these steps in any order you prefer. They're not sequential.  
                  </p> <br>
                  <p>
                    -- Add your IMEI numbers of any device type you own (for instance, your smartphone) and indicate whether its with you or not.
                  </p><br>
                  <p>
                    -- Search for any IMEI number and know whether its stolen or missing
                  </p><br>
                  <p>
                    -- Share with your friends when you learn an IMEI is no longer with the owner (in other words, its stolen or missing)
                  </p><br>
                  <p>
                    I serve you best using the steps above.
                  </p><br>
                  <p>
                    Enjoy your stay
                  </p>

              </div>
              <div class="span6" style="height:auto;">
                <div class="blogpost page-transition" href="">
                  <span class="figcap"></span>

                  <h2>What is IMEI number?</h2>
                  
                  <p>
                    International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI), is used to identify a particular mobile phone. Every mobile phone comes with an IMEI and they're unique globally. 
                  </p><br>
                  <p>
                    And because these IMEI are unique across all devices with them, Menpha employs that uniqueness in its reporting system, preventing a single IMEI from being added twice.
                  </p><br>
                  <p>
                    With this in mind, you can expect only a single result whenever you search against my database. If you do not come across a results of your search query, then it is likely the device is still in safe hands and you can proceed to purchase.
                  </p>
