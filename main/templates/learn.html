                  </p> <br>
                  <p>
                    -- Add your IMEI numbers of any device type you own (for instance, your smartphone) and indicate whether it is with you or not.
                  </p><br>
                  <p>
                    -- Search for any IMEI number and know whether its stolen or missing
                  </p><br>
                  <p>
                    --  You can choose to share the results with your friends when you learn an IMEI is no longer with the owner (in other words, stolen or missing).
                  </p><br>
                  <p>

                  <h2>What is IMEI number?</h2>
                  
                  <p>
                    International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI), is used to identify a particular mobile phone. Every mobile phone comes with an IMEI and they're unique globally. 
                  </p><br>
                  <p>
                    And because these IMEI are unique across all devices with them, Menpha employs that uniqueness in its reporting system, preventing a single IMEI from being added twice.
                  </p><br>
                  <p>
                    With this in mind, you can expect only a single result whenever you search against my database. If you do not come across a results of your search query, then it is likely the device is still in safe hands and you can proceed to purchase.
                  </p>
